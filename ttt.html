		<p>Good evening! I go by Stvff online, and I've been programming in one way or another for roughly 6 years. My first language was TI-BASIC on the TI-84CE, and nowadays I have plenty of experience with Odin, C, Go, Processing, as well as many other languages and platforms.<br/>
			Once someone learns to program, language becomes an implementation detail.</p>
