	Good evening! I go by Stvff online, and I've been programming in one way or another for roughly 6 years.
	My first language was TI-BASIC on the TI-84CE, and nowadays I have plenty of experience with Odin, C, Go, Processing, as well as many other languages and platforms.<br/>
	Once someone learns to program, language becomes an implementation detail.
</p><p>
	I've long been fascinated with describing the world through rulesets, regardless of the field.
	On this website, you'll mostly see my programming projects (and only the ones I deem presentable), but the majority of them have a lot of math and physics woven throughout.
	Aside from physics and math, I have a big interest in programming language design, and recently, game design as well.
</p><p>
	Most of what I know I taught myself with help from friends and the internet.
	I've studied physics at the University of Groningen, and Electrical Engineering at the University of Twente, but stopped because of personal reasons. I'm currently looking for work.
</p>
<h2>Website overview</h2>
<ul>
	<li> Under the <b>Languages</b> header in the navigation bar, you'll find experimental programming/scripting languages that I wrote.</li>
	<!--<li> <b>Games</b> lists my video game prototypes.</li>-->
	<li> The <b>Tools</b> are small utility programs or libraries.</li>
	<!--<li> <b>Bad Apple</b> is a black-and-white music video that is often used to show off cool visual effects, and I made some physics-based ones.</li>-->
	<li> Naturally, <b>Miscellaneous</b> lists some projects that aren't easily grouped, but worth showing regardless.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	I try to have publically available code, but sometimes it doesn't make sense to publish a very work-in-progress codebase.
	That is to say, most but not all of these will have available code. Naturally, not every project I've ever done is listed on this website either,
	just the ones I think would be interesting to talk about.
</p>
<h2>My Goals</h2>
<p>
	I wrote a little motto at the top of this page, which highlights something I find important and strive towards. A system/architecture
	with 'clarity' is not nessecarily one that is instrinsically easy to describe, but one that is understood in full. 
	If not by one person, at least by a small group of people.
	<!-- This is not achieved via 'readable code', but is a result of deliberate design.
	Undesigned opaque systems might work, but have disasterous consequences for the wellbeing of everyone involved with it, including users.-->
</p><p>
	It follows from my interest in understanding and describing systems that I am very opinionated on software architecture and quality.
	Not a day goes by that I don't enounter multiple software (breaking) bugs, and that deeply saddens me.
	So much of our world is built on computers, but we've managed to make digital systems so complex that it all becomes
	nondeterministic, which is a shame, but not unavoidable or unfixable. I don't have all solutions (nor do I have all experiences),
	but as long as we can have an honest conversation about 'industry standard software quality', we're moving forward.
