<h1>Vanadis</h1>
<p>
	Vanadis is a low-level, memory-oriented assembly style scripting language.<br/>
	Its core idea is that memory is inherently typeless, and that 'type' is a property of the operations you perform on that memory.
</p><p>
	The interpreter is a single executable, and since Vanadis actually compiles to a custom bytecode before it runs, the interpreter
	can do this compilation step ahead of time, and produce a bytecode file. Similarly, it can only check the code, without running or building.
	It can check for basic errors (missing arguments, incorrect value kinds, unknown names), and gives coloured error messages with clear line and column reporting.
	There is even a debug mode, with settable breakpoints.
</p><p>
	This vanadis script asks the user for a number, and calculates the fibonacci sequence upto that many iterations, after which the user can choose to print the result (as an array):
<pre><code class="Vanadis">u8 alloc 3
u64
def Fibseq = 0$
def Iterations = 2$[0]
def Newsize = 1$!

mov Fibseq, 0 + 1;
chr print "How many iterations?\n> ", 1
u64 input Iterations~, 0^, 0;

:loop, u64
    add Newsize, Fibseq.l, 1t
    rsz Fibseq, Newsize
    add Fibseq<2t>, Fibseq<0>, Fibseq<1t>*
    dec Iterations

    cmp Iterations, 0
        Cg jmp loop

chr print "Print?\nN/y> ", 1
chr input Iterations~, 0^, 0
cmp Iterations, "y"!
    u64 Ce print Fibseq, 0

free 3

	Vanadis was my answer to all the things I was missing in <a target="_blank" href="arbasm.html">ArbAsm.</a><br/>
	As such, as a scripting language, it is much more powerful in many ways,
	and while it does borrow a couple ideas in syntax and memory model, it no longer has the arbitrary precision arithmetic.
</p><p>
	Despite the project being much more mature than ArbAsm,
	Vanadis' <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Stvff/Vanadis">GitHub page</a> does not have a complete readme,
	or much proper documentation, which is a shame. It does have a lot of
	<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Stvff/Vanadis/tree/master/scripts">scripts</a> that can be imported in other
	Vanadis projects. Some stuff I wrote in Vanadis includes:
	<ul>
	<li>basic 3D vector math (including transformation matrices)</li>
	<li>MS BMP reading and writing functions, with error reporting</li>
	<li>Image utility functions</li>
	<li>WAV file reading and writing functions, with error reporting</li>
	<li>Basic wave equation simulations</li>
	<li>Rule 110 (as is customary)</li>
	<li>STL utility functions</li>
	<li>STL wireframe renderer, which really deserves its own page on this website</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Memory model and language description</h2>
<p>
	As mentioned, the core idea is that memory is inherently typeless, and that 'type' is a property of the operations you perform on that memory.<br/>
	The fundamental data structure is the 'page', which is essentially a dynamic array of bytes.<br/>
	Pages have an intrinsic offset that you can set and optionally index from (in both directions: negative indices are supported and accounted for).
	When you index a page, you get a datum, the value of which is dependent on the current type of operation.
</p><p>
	There are no addressable registers, instead everything is indexed off of the stack. Next to the stack, there is the 'codex', which you can flip
	pages to and from, for more elaborate stack reordering operations (comparable to a train shunting yard).
</p><p>
	A statement in vanadis has four parts, of which two are optional:
<pre><code class="Vanadis">type condition instruction expression</code></pre>
	<code>type</code> is anything from <code>u8</code>, to <code>f64</code>. If no type is given, the instruction assumes the type that was set last.
	This means you'll often see code that just has a single type annotation at the top, with a set of instructions underneath.<br/>
	<code>condition</code> is any of a small set of short keywords, that denote whether or not an instruction should execute if the last <code>cmp</code> (comparison)
	operation yielded: greater than, smaller than, equal to.<br/>
	<code>instruction</code> is any of the supported instructions that Vanadis provide, most of them basic arithmetic or logic, a couple of them IO and memory operations.<br/>
	Finally, <code>expression</code> is the list of arguments for the instruction, which itself could be seen as tiny concatenative register machine.
	The operators used in expressions are things like: stack indexing, page indexing, offset resetting
