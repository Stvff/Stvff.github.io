<h1>ArbAsm</h1>
<p>
	ArbAsm is my first language project that got to a usable state.</br>
	It is an assembly-styled scripting language for arbitrary precision integer arithmetic, written in C.
	'Arbitrary precision' means that the numbers in ArbAsm can have any amount of digits (as long as memory permits).
</p><p>
	The interpreter is a single (portable) executable, which can either run a REPL, or run ArbAsm source files directly.
	Source files are simple text files, with the <code>.aasm</code> extension.
	Its <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Stvff/ArbAsm">GitHub page</a> has a description of installation and usage,
	<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Stvff/ArbAsm/tree/master/scripts">a lot of sample programs</a>, and even a relatively extensive
	<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Stvff/ArbAsm/wiki/Standard-library-glossary">wiki page</a>.<br/>
	Here's some ArbAsm code that does a simple benchmark:
<pre><code class="ArbAsm">set ir, 0              ; `ir` is the general purpose iteration register
set endian, 1          ; This sets the endianness of the interpreter to big endian
set gr1, 30 000 000    ; This is the amount of loops the program will do

push time              ; Saving the value from the time register to the stack
:speedloop             ; A label
    inc ir
    cmp ir, gr1
    Cs jmp "speedloop" ; Does a jump to `speedloop`, if the previous comparison yielded a "smaller than" result

print ir               ; Prints the amount of iterations that were done

sub $0, time           ; Subtracts the current time from the value on top of the stack,
mul $0, 1-             ; which was the time at the start of the loop

trunc $0               ; Removes leading zeroes
print $0               ; Prints the amount of time it took to run in seconds
</code></pre>

	It originally started as a command line calculator tool, but it ended up growing into a scripting language,
	wayy outside what it was intended for, so it's very clunky (and too slow) to use for actual programming.
</p><p>
	That being said, here are some things I have done with it (most of these can be found in the aformentioned scripts directory):
	<ul>
	<li>Digits of Pi calculator</li>
	<li>MandelBrot in the command line</li>
	<li>Rule 110</li>
	<li>Basic MS BMP reader and writer</li>
	<li>Basic bitmap colour filtering and image splicing</li>
	</ul>
	It also has some quaternion stuff, but for that to really be useful, it needed square roots,
	for which I couldn't figure out a performant and neat method at the time.

<h2>Short language description</h2>
<p>
	The underlying machine model is as following:<br/>
	There are a couple of general purpose registers that the user has full control over,
	and a couple of registers that are either read-only, or that have side effects over the operation
	of the interpreter.<br/>
	Next to this, there are two stacks: one that you can directly push, pop and index into, and another one that
	you can use as a sort of 'shunting yard' for the main stack.<br/>
	There is only one type, the Number (which is a dynamic array of bytes), that can be used as a arbitrary precision integer, a string,
	or simply as an array of bytes.
</p><p>
	Statements have the form of an instruction followed by its arguments, with the destination operand going first (Intel argument ordering).
</p>
<h2>Broader Context of the project</h2>
<p>
	Arbitrary precision math is a pretty well researched topic (to the point where there are FFT version of multiplication algorithms),
	but for this project, I hadn't read up on any of that. It's all manual exploration with a noteback and some late nights.
	Most of my arithmetic operators here have terrible computational complexity, and since it's some of my first C code, it's hard to read
	and makes a lot of odd decisions. Nevertheless, I'm still proud with how far I was able to go with how limited it all is.
