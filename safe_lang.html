<h1>Beyond Static Analysis</h1>
<p>
	There are many programming languages out there, but most are not doing much new or interesting things.
	With this concept, I want to propose a language with a memory model that discourages fragmentation.
	Next to that, there are some extra ideas about indexing arrays.
</p>

<h2>Memory Model</h2>

<h2>Indexing</h2>
Normal way that we are used to:
<pre><code>value = array[index];
</code></pre>

But indexing can always fail, we'll add a fallback value.
<pre><code>value = array[index] else use 0;
</code></pre>

This is a whole branch of course.
<pre><code>value = array[index] else {
	log("Index out of bounds!", index);
	use 0;
}
</code></pre>

But what only that, just the optional branch happens, as well as the main flow.
As an example, when you need to print a value with an index, you don't want to print
the backup value.
So, there needs to be a 'success' branch:
<pre><code>value = array[index] {
	log(index, ":", value);
} else {
	log("Index out of bounds!", index);
	use 0;
}
</code></pre>

Now we run into the problem that this is very verbose, more verbose than practical for
when multiple arrays need to be indexed multiple times.
<pre><code>index = index*10 + 3;
assure index in array_one & array_two {} else {
	log("!");
	use 9;
}

constrain array_two in array_one;
for {
	i += 1;
	//constrain index in array1.size;
	constrain index to array1.size;

	value = array1[index] + array2[index];
}
</code></pre>
