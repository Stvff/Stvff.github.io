<h1 id="top">Manyfold</h1>
<p>
	This is a 3D modeling engine library, which means that it can be used to write a program that generates
	a 3D mesh. It can export to <a tag="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_(file_format)"><code>.ply</code></a>, <a tag="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)"><code>.stl</code></a> and <a tag="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file"><code>.obj</code></a>.
</p><p>
	Manyfold's paradigm allows it to guarentee a volume is 'closed'. In this context, that means that,
	unless you tell it otherwise, it will not export any object with 2D (or 1D) features. In less formal terms, objects that you can 3D print with infill.
</p><p>
	Currently, Manyfold is nothing more than a module for the programming language <a tag="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Blow#Jai_language">Jai</a> (which is in closed beta).
	I have hopes of making a proper GUI tool around it, but 3D modeling GUI's are inherently very complicated, and I do not see a solid (hehe) way forward for it.

<h2>The Paradigm</h2>
<p>
	The name 'Manyfold' is a play on the mathematical concept of the <a tag="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold">manifold</a>.
	Manifolds can (in very loose terms) be described as maps between spaces. For our purposes, the most important example is a <a tag="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology)">surface</a>.
	A position on a surface can be defined with 2 numbers (surfaces are 2D), but the surface itself can exist in any higher number of dimensions, in our case, 3.
