<h1 id="top">Manyfold</h1>
<p>
	Roughly speaking, the set of all 3D modeling tools can be divided into three catagories:
	<ol>
		<li>A single, simple paradigm</li>
		<li>All of the paradigms at the same time</li>
		<li>All of the paradigms at the same time (corporate yearly license edition)</li>
	</ol>
	All of these can be extremely useful. Especially the last two catagories have the highest 'ceiling of usefulness',
	because they're made to do whatever the user (or client, in catagory 3) wants it to do.
</p><p>
	Of course, this multifacetedness does come at a cost. The learning curve for these programs is primarily dominated
	by the accumulation of knowledge about what features there are, as opposed to learning how to most effectively utilize
	one single idea (or at least a very small set of ideas). Many larger industry standard tools in most fields 'suffer' from this.
	I put 'suffer' in quotes, because, as with all things, there is a lot of nuance.<br/>
	However, it would be off-topic to go into detail (I might write another post about it at some point).
</p><p>
	For now I'll say that catagory 2 and 3 are not inherently bad, but that I don't enjoy using tools of that nature.
</p>
<h2>An idea</h2>
<p>
	I've been thinking for a while about what would make sense as the simplest and most powerful paradigm for designing non-artistic solids.
	There are existing options, but to me, it seemed that none of them were fully useful in isolation. In particular, I've been
	looking for something that would allow arbitrary freeform curves and surfaces in 3D space to be straighforward to create.<br/>
	<a tag="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_rational_B-spline">NURBs</a> come close, but are not quite it,
	as they are not arbitrary (they are B-splines).
</p><p>
	By approximation, <a tag="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_360">Autodesk Fusion</a> (even though it is a catagory 2-3 program in practice)
	is vaguely based around extruding, sweeping, and rotating sketches (which 2D parametric constraint-based vector drawings).
	However, I couldn't quite put my finger on a solid and robust way to implement that in a way that remained pure.
</p><p>
	Finally, when I saw Wierd 3D Pixel tool, I got a more tangible idea of what I wanted to have, even though it was not at all like that tool.
<p>
<h2>What I made</h2>
	Manyfold is a 3D modeling engine library, which means that it can be used to write a program that generates
	a 3D mesh. It can export to <a tag="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_(file_format)"><code>.ply</code></a>, <a tag="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)"><code>.stl</code></a> and <a tag="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file"><code>.obj</code></a>.
</p><p>
	Manyfold's paradigm allows it to guarentee a volume is 'closed'. In this context, that means that,
	unless you tell it otherwise, it will not export any object with 2D (or 1D) features. In less formal terms, objects that you can 3D print with infill.
</p><p>
	Currently, Manyfold is nothing more than a module for the programming language <a tag="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Blow#Jai_language">Jai</a> (which is in closed beta).
	I have hopes of making a proper GUI tool around it, but 3D modeling GUIs are inherently very complicated, and I do not see a solid (hehe) way forward for it.
</p>
<h2>The Paradigm</h2>
<p>
	The name 'Manyfold' is a play on the mathematical concept of the <a tag="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold">manifold</a>.
	Manifolds can (in very loose terms) be described as maps between spaces. For our purposes, the most important example is a <a tag="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(topology)">surface</a>.
	A position on a surface can be defined with 2 numbers (surfaces are 2D), but the surface itself can exist in any higher number of dimensions, in our case, 3.
