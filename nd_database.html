<h1>N-Dimensional database with decent locality</h1>
<p>
	At some point in a girl's life, there comes a time where a dataset has more than one dimension.
	It is imperative to her career that the datastructure she chooses for this is regular,
	and ordered for the most relevant dimension(s).
</p><p>
	What we will be doing today is none of that. We want to be cool and esoteric with it.<br/>
	We want a datastructure where similar coordinates in space result in similar indices in linear memory.
	An important implication of this is that selecting a subsection of the total dataset becomes a more local
	operation as well, regardless of the direction or dimensionality that subsection has.
