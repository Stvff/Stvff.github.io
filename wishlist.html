<h1 id="top">Some math problems that I don't have a good solution for</h1>
<p>
	I recently realized that I was having a lot of math problems that I couldn't find a good way to solve,
	so I thought I might as well write them down and share them online.
	All these are for personal projects of mine, nothing huge or industry-shaking.
</p><p>
	If you have good info, or straight-up solutions, feel very free to contact me via email!
	Alternatively, maybe they can serve as fun excercises if you're bored.
	If I solve any, I'll mark them as solved, and share my findings.

<h2 id="quartic">A very specific Quartic Equation</h2>
<figure>
	<img alt="0 = lambda^2 a + lambda b + c - (lambda^2 d + lambda f + g)/(lambda^2 h + lambda k + m)" src="assets/quartic_form_1.png"/>
	<figcaption>The equation in question</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	The goal is a basic formula/program to solve for the smallest real and positive lambda. All other variables in the equation are known, real and positive.
	The context is a simple program on the gpu that has to solve this equation in parallel for many datapoints.
</p><p>
	It can be rewritten into a more obviously quartic equation like so (keeping in mind that lambda^2 h + lambda k + m != 0):
<figure>
	<img alt="0 = (lambda^2 a + lambda b + c)*(lambda^2 h + lambda k + m) - lambda^2 d + lambda f + g" src="assets/quartic_form_2.png"/>
	<img alt="0 = lambda^4 ah + lambda^3 (bh + ak) + lambda^2 (ch + bk + am - d) + lambda (ck + bm - f) - g" src="assets/quartic_form_3.png"/>
	<figcaption>Quartic formulation</figcaption>
</figure>
	And a formula for solving quartic equations <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartic_function#Solution">does exist</a>, but:
	<ul>
		<li>It has multiple solutions, of which I want only 1 specific one.</li>
		<li>It is computationally expensive, with complex (as in real-imaginairy) arithmetic and a lot of square roots.</li>
		<li>It is made to solve the most general case of the equation, which is not this case, mine has a lot of constraints.</li>
	</ul>
</p><p>
	Right now, I'm planning to solve this by doing a basic good guess, and doing some iteration based on the derivative of the function.

	This one is a little bit emberassing, but it's been a while since I've done a proper 2D
	integral, and I do not have a good intuition for how I should go about it.
</p><p>
	With some help from friends and Wolfram Alpha, I finally got this one.
	It turned out to be quite a complicated integral, so it might be a while before I translate it all to LaTeX.

<h2 id="very_hyper_sonic">A Method for simulating aerodynamics at orbital velocities and low density gasses</h2>
<p>
	Any discussion on fluid simulation must acknowledge that solving the Navier Stokes Equations
	is really difficult, hypersonic flow (and above) especially so. That being said, I suspect that there are some good
	approximations you can make with a really low density (very upper atmosphere) and weakly self-interacting gas.
	The question is mostly how far those approximations apply.
</p><p>
	I haven't done a perfect problem formulation for this yet, but I will eventually update this with specific velocities
	and densities.
