<h1 id="top">Diagnosis</h1>
<p>
	Imagine living in a blue house. At some point, you start running into problems with the sink, so you call a plumber.<br/>
	The plumber comes over, looks at the sink, and gives a professional opinion: "I'm going to call a buddy of mine to take a stab at this."<br/>
	The plumber's buddy comes over, sees the house, looks at the sink, makes a professional remark: "I've seen many sinks just like this in blue houses.", and immediately fixes the problem.<br/>
	What a relief.
</p><p>
	Later, you move to a different (equally blue) house. You've made friends with everyone in the blue neighborhood, and regularly attend community meetings.<br/>
	At one of these meetings, someone remarks "They really didn't know how to make sinks for blue houses!"<br/>
	Everyone laughs. You haven't had a problem with your sink in the new house.<br/>
	"At least the bathtubs are large." The community jovially agrees with you.
</p><p>
	This happens quite often in psychology (and sometimes medicine),
	but it's not intentional.</br>
	At least, it's not meant to be.
</p><p>
	Diagnosis only happens when there is a problem, and the stated official symptoms to base a diagnosis on
