<h2>Broad outline of the idea of the game</h2>
<p>
The player controls a spacecraft that is in a mission around Jupiter.<br/>
It starts close to Io, where the craft has been constructed/brought using a larger interplanetary transport system. The craft is going
at escape velocity, and it needs to slow down and circularize. This is the 'tutorial', it'll show the player how to change
orientation and orbit, as well as where to keep track of the available resources. After getting into a relatively low orbit around Jupiter,
the player is free to do anything. There will be fast-forward, and time rewind. The player can adjust orbit, attitude, etc, using an 'orbit editor'.
There will be several instruments on board to observe Jupiter and collect data with.
</p>
<p>
The two limits to the 'free roam' are: depleting all resources, and diving too deep into Jupiter. The goal is to both 'survive'
as long as possible, and to get and send as much data home as possible. Final score will be decided by some combination of both.
This final score may manifest as different endings, depending on how the player played.

<p>
Realism is the central focus of the project. Everything should behave and look like it would in real life. It should give realistic intuitions
about how reality looks and behaves. Some freedoms are afforded since the setting is an alternate universe.
