<h1 id="top">Dive</h1>
<p>
	Dive is an imperative procedural language, that lives just on the edge of being a structured language,
	and compiles to a simple bytecode (with plans for more). This means that instead of jumping to or
	calling labels, all code blocks in Dive are named and typechecked (so you can't jump to a procedure or call a basic block)
	Furthermore, variables are statically and strongly typed with a basic typesystem. Procedure calls are pass-by-value.
</p><p>
	Dive's <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Stvff/dive">GitHub Page</a> has a simple 'getting started' tutorial,
	so on this page, I'll discuss some more meta aspects of its design and development.
</p><p>
	Here's a recursive factorial function in Dive, there is a :
<pre><code class="Dive">import basic/print.dive;

total: u64;
total = call factorial 10;
call println_u64 total;

factorial :: (n: u64 -- m: u64) {
    is_zero: u8;
    is_zero = equ n 0;
    if is_zero base_case;

    m = sub n 1;
    m = call factorial m;
    m = mul n m;
    return;

    base_case :: {
        m = 1;
        return;
    }
}
</code></pre>
</p><p>
	After doing a lot of work in <a target="_blank" href="vanadis.html">Vanadis</a>, it started to get really clear
	to me why languages have a local stack frame with typed variables (the sort of thing you don't notice till you miss it).
	On top of that, Vanadis was a little hard to read, and mathematical expressions were cumbersome to write.
	Because of esoteric decisions of the interpreter and paradigm, performance was starting to become a concern as well.
</p><p>
	So, for Dive, I wanted clear function signatures, typed variables, scopes, proper expressions, as well as an interpreter with a bytecode so straightforward,
	an assembly transpiler could be written after the fact. Two big inspirations for this project were Jai and Odin, and I was even thinking about
	compile-time execution, it was not a main focus.
</p><p>
	Currently, there are no proper expressions yet (I've been planning a big rework with them included, but it's big and I got distracted)
	But it does have clear function signatures, typed variables and scopes, so it gets to determine and check a lot of things at compiletime.
	The bytecode generator is also pretty 'advanced', gathering all variables of all static scopes, and putting them all with proper alignment
	(and thus packed) on the stack, translating variable names to stack indexing, etc.
</p><p>
	Also, Dive has more proper multifile compilation (not just "insert file" like C's <code>#include</code>), and can resolve symbols declared out-of-order.
</p><p>
	The bytecode itself is a Three Access Code, so quite simple (and therefore fast) to parse and run. It <emph>should</emph> be pretty straightforward to translate to
	nasm assembly, but I've not yet found the time to look into it deeply, especially because other parts of the language need a lot more work first.
	There is a unix <code>syscall</code> instruction, so code can actually interface with the OS directly for file IO, and allocators.
</p><p>
	I've not done a lot with Dive, it's honestly missing a lot of stuff to be usefull (no array or string literals, no structs),
	and the main puzzle of its development ended up learning compilerdesign for this new paradigm of programming language.<br/>
	As such, the only things I've done with it are (all of these can be found in the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Stvff/dive/progams">programs folder on GitHub</a>):
	<ul>
	<li>Basic file IO (based on unix syscalls)</li>
	<li>Extremely basic allocator (using mmap)</li>
	<li>Beginnings of a printing library</li>
	<li>fibonacci</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h2>In Conclusion</h2>
<p>
	Dive has some cool ideas (and it is pleasant on the eyes to me personally), but it's really deeply incomplete, and needs a lot more attention and a rethink.
	That being said, I learned a lot of things doing it, that will be (and have already been) very useful for my <a href="triops.html">next programming language exploration</a>.
